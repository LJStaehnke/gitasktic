In this experiment we will present blocks of visual stimuli. They will presented one stimulus at a time.  Your task is to press the key corresponding to the matching stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible after each stimulus is presented.  The mappings between stimuli and specific keyboard responses will change for each block.  Either an X or an O.

We will now review each stimulus prior to beginning the blocks.

Press any key to continue....
"""

final_inst = """We will now begin the actual experiment.  Before each block we will display a screen specifying what the mapping from the stimuli to the specific keys will be for that block.  Please take a moment before beginning the block to learn the new mapping. Remember, you need to wait after the stimulus is off the screen, and press the corresponding button.

If you still not clear about any part of instruction, please ask adminstor before began.

Press any key to continue...
